						<h3>About Me</h3>
					</div>
					<div id="ab-desc">
						<p>Hey! I'm Misha, a senior at Roger Williams University studying Computer Science and 
							Mathematics, with a minor in Business Analytics. I've found my passion in Data Science, 
							where I can use my programming skills to extract stories and predictions from seas of 
							messy information. I've interned at the energy management firm Best Practice Energy, 
							which I've helped automate their process for collecting data on peak electricity usage 
							and commodity futures strips. I also work in my campus' Office of Institutional 
							Research, and am the President of the Analytics Club. My main languages are Python, 
							Java, and Octave, though I've also been exposed to SQL and HTML/CSS.
						    <br>
						    <br>
						    Regarding my personal life, I was born in the coastal city of Zushi, Japan before 
							moving to Bristol, Rhode Island at the age of two. When I'm not busy studying, you'll 
							likely find me practicing the piano/guitar/bass, listening to my favorite artists (The 
							Beach Boys, Animal Collective, The Smiths, etc.), or geeking over shows like <i>Neon 
							Genesis Evangelion</i> and <i>Twin Peaks</i>.
						    <br>

						<p>For the <b>2020 Scholastic Analytics Challenge</b>, hosted by the Association for 
						   Information Systems (AIS), my team analyzed 2,000,000 children's book orders to (1) find 
						   demographic trends in sales and (2) create a new strategy to help Scholastic reach all 
						   children, regardless of demographic. We used Python to clean the data of duplicate book 
						   titles that were inconsistently spelled, and Tableau to visualize the data. Out of 60 
						   schools in the challenge, our presentation <i>won 1st place</i> in the Analysis 
						   category. You can read our infographic

						<p> A favorite project from my Machine Learning class was programming two <b>movie 
							recommenders</b>. The first system applies <i>content-based</i> filtering: the user 
							selects a movie, and is then returned similar movies based on shared tags (for example, 
							<i>Toy Story</i> and <i>Shrek</i> might share 'fantasy'). The second system applies 
							<i>collaborative</i> filtering: User A rates several films of their choosing from 1 to 
							5, is matched with a User B with the most similar rating pattern, and is returned films 
							highly-rated by B that A had not rated yet. You can review my content-based recommender

					<p>Two fellow classmates and I are currently developing our Senior Design project: <b>NiCoMi 
					   Analytics</b>. Our mission statement:
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="solid">Intended for academic use, the NiCoMi Analytics web application will collect 
					   data from supported marketing services to generate dashboards that measure the success of 
					   clients' online marketing campaigns. These services range from social media to website 
					   trackers to ad clients. We plan for a customizable experience, with users being able to 
					   choose the metrics included in their dashboards and stylize as needed. Ultimately, NiCoMi 
					   Analytics will allow Digital Marketing students to grow in their consultation skills, and 
					   local businesses in their online presence.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
					   Currently, we have developed much of the front-end using HTML and CSS, One page, tentatively 
					   entitled 'Social Media', displays a grid of marketing services such as Facebook, YouTube, 
					   and Google Analytics. Courtesy of the Facebook SDK, we have implemented a login button that, 
					   when clicked, asks the user to authorize the application to access their data. Upon 
					   authorization, the application receives a token that grants access to the Facebook Graph 
					   API, from where page-related data will be requested. We now plan to implement authentication 
					   for all other services and familiarize ourselves with the D3.js library, which will 
					   visualize our data as charts, graphs, etc.
